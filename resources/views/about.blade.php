        <p>Iâ€™m Nad Chishtie, but you can just call me Nad.</p>
        <p>Originally hailing from the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ for the last decade or so Iâ€™ve been honing my skills in design, production and management roles building products for the web, mobile, games and, more recently, VR & AR.</p>
        <p>I strive to create elegant solutions that surprise and delight users, while keeping complex technical dependencies in mind for implementation, scalability and developer sanity.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™ve worked with small, agile teams on skunkworks projects and larger development teams with product lifecycles spanning multiple years.</p>
        <p>Depending on the team, resources and deliverables Iâ€™ve worn many hats over the years - holding titles like Product Designer, UI Designer, UX Designer, Front-end Developer, Growth Lead, Producer, Product Manager & Product Owner.</p>
        <p>I also occasionally give talks on design and product development.</p>
